This is a PHP-based RESTful API interface for connecting to multiple APIs. Currently in the works are Bitcoin / Ethereum / STEEM custom APIs, with more to come in the future. You can add you own API by using the BLANK.api.class.php template file in /lib/classes/custom-api/, and adding that API in the allowed APIs in the config.php file. You must set you API key creation password on the web page /api/v1/create-api-key.php after uploading to your server. If you have any issues with this, make sure /api/v1/data/auth.dat is writable on your server filesystem.
